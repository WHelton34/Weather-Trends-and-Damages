Rainfall deficits of 4-6 inches during this timeframe sparked the introduction of severe drought across almost all of eastern Kentucky by the second and third weeks in November. Extreme drought also developed across much of the Cumberland Valley toward the end of November as the 4th driest fall on record was recorded at both Jackson and London. Additionally, the Fall of 2016 was the warmest on record across eastern Kentucky.||Early impacts ranged from farm ponds drying up and low streamflows in southern Kentucky to a few cities, such as Salyersville, mentioning possible water supply issues without significant rainfall by the end of November. Several farmers also mentioned the early consumption of hay by cattle, possibly leading to a shortage into the winter.||Wildfire activity began to rapidly increase across eastern Kentucky, especially southeastern Kentucky, by late October. The Kentucky State Emergency Operations Center was activated on November 3rd as at least five wildfires flared up across Harlan County, while three schools in Pike County were forced to close due to dense smoke. A state of emergency was later declared by the governor on the 3rd after meeting with the Kentucky Division of Forestry.||Impacts from as many as 41 wildfires at any one time became numerous rather quickly as nearly 500 personnel from the Kentucky Division of Forestry, Kentucky Fire Commission, Natural Resource Conservation Services, the Kentucky National Guard, and American Red Cross were deployed to southeastern Kentucky to assist local fire departments in fighting wildland fires. Crews battled the flames from both the ground and air as the Kentucky National Guard mobilized six UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 600-gallon buckets and two LUH-72 Lakotas, dumping nearly 2 million gallons of water over approximately 50,000 acres.||One fire in Harlan County was responsible for consuming 7,400 acres on Pine Mountain. Kentucky Highway 1679 (Little Shepherds Trail) in Harlan County was closed to all traffic, except emergency vehicles, from Swap to the entrance of Kingdom Come State Park, while a portion of the Red River Gorge in the Daniel Boone National Forest was closed for several days along Tunnel Ridge Road north of Mountain Parkway. Numerous other roadways were closed as burned trees toppled over and smoke produced reduced visibilities. On the morning of November 16th, near-zero visibilities developed on Mountain Parkway just east of the Slade exit as smoke became extremely dense at ground level. A 12 car pileup resulted, injuring approximately 20 people and causing one fatality as a man stepped out of his coal truck to help others. Mountain Parkway was closed for over 10 hours between exits 22 and 40. One home was burned down in Knott County, while smoke and flames endangered several additional homes near Putney and Cumberland in Harlan County. Sadly, one firefighter passed away after being injured battling a late October brushfire near Beverly in Bell County. The city of Jackson and the National Weather Service office were also impacted by nearby wildfires and smoke, including the Eagles Nest Fire.||Burn bans were eventually issued for all 33 counties in eastern Kentucky, helping the state of Kentucky receive a Fire Management Assistance Grant from FEMA Region IV to support continuing fire operations in southeastern Kentucky. These continued until November 28th when the Kentucky Division of Forestry, National Guard, and Kentucky Fire Commission were demobilized as increasing moisture filtered into eastern Kentucky prior to resulting in widespread rainfall amounts of 1-4 inches.",128

This dry period contributed to a 7 day stretch of temperatures in the 90s from September 27th through October 3rd. This was the first time temperatures ever climbed into the 90s in the month of October since records began at Jackson. Large rainfall deficits created high evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture losses, resulting in escalated drought impacts throughout the month.

However, there was a sharp cutoff to this heavy rainfall, with much of the far southeast portion of the state only seeing around a half of an inch of total accumulation as opposed to 2 inches or more toward the Bluegrass region. This led to the expansion of Extreme Drought (D3) across a majority of southeast Kentucky, especially closer to the Virginia border. This rainfall that fell across eastern Kentucky was quickly absorbed by the dry soils, not offering much relief to the top soils or streams and rivers. ||At the beginning of the month, extreme drought (D3) extended roughly from areas east of the Daniel Boone National Forest, along Mountain Parkway and southward to the Letcher County line. Severe drought (D2) generally remained south of the Interstate 64 corridor, while shrinking with extent through the month due to sufficient enough rainfall.||Burn bans were in effect for most counties in eastern Kentucky at the beginning of the month, with many of these being lifted into the second week of October.

In addition, crop moisture was excessively dry with yield prospects reduced. Pasture and hay conditions were also poor. Many farmers were supplementing feed for livestock well in advance of the winter months. This all led to 15 counties across eastern Kentucky being declared as primary disaster areas by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Forage specialists said that at this time of year, regrowth would only be minimal, but the Agricultural Weather Center at the University of Kentucky reported that the widespread early-mid month rains likely promoted pasture growth and at least somewhat replenished ponds.||Streams across eastern Kentucky ran near to below normal in early October, before running near normal by mid month.||In Harlan County, the community of Benham experienced a water shortage as the mountain streams that normally provide the town's water had seen substantially lower flows. After dry conditions resulted in this low flow of water into the town, the town got approval to begin pumping water from the nearby Cumberland River.

The combination of strong winds, very warm temperatures, dry fuels, and low relative humidities were very favorable for rapid fire spread and a number of small wildfires ended up breaking out across eastern Kentucky.||     After a brief lull in the gusts during the evening of the 30th, the most intense winds with this storm system roared across eastern Kentucky from midnight to 4 AM on the 31st along and just ahead of a line of decaying showers moving in from the west. Wind gusts peaked in the 40 to 60 mph range across much of the forecast area during this time frame. Numerous power outages resulted, especially near/southwest of KY-15. Among the hardest hit was Owsley County, where over half the county lost power for a few hours overnight when the powerful winds blew a large tree down and damaged infrastructure near a substation. The winds also blew trees down onto power lines leading to downed lines and snapped power poles. A few instances of significant roof damage were also reported.",200

These thunderstorms, at times, caused rainfall rates in excess of 4/hr across complex terrain that led to widespread devastating impacts. While it did not rain continuously during this 4-day stretch, the overwhelming amounts of rain and resultant flooding led to 39 deaths and widespread catastrophic damage. Entire homes and parts of some communities were swept away by flood waters, leading to costly damage to infrastructure in the region. Over 600 helicopter rescues and countless swift water rescues by boat were needed to evacuate people who were trapped by the quickly-rising flood waters. In total, 24 Flash Flood Warnings were issued between July 26th and July 30th. Between the evening of July 27th and the mid-morning hours on July 28th (the peak of the event), 13 warnings were issued, 3 of which were upgraded to a Flash Flood Emergency.||Radar-based rainfall estimates suggest that upwards of 14-16 of rain fell during this 5-day period in a narrow swath, with many more locations receiving 6-10 of rain. Most of this rain fell during the night of July 27th into the morning of July 28th, which is when the most devastating impacts were felt. The highest totals occurred across an axis that stretches from northern Clay and southern Owsley counties, east through southern Breathitt and northern Leslie counties, into Perry, Knott and Letcher counties. The highest rainfall total report was from southern Knott County, where 14.00 fell between July 25th and July 29th. This site, a cooperative (COOP) observer at Carr Creek Lake, reported 6.71 from 7am July 28th to 7am July 29th, following a report of 6.50 at that site on the previous day. Another COOP site in Buckhorn reported 8.00 of rain for the 24-hour period ending 7am on July 28th. The rainfall total in Buckhorn from July 25th to July 29th was 11.76. These rainfall values occurring in such a short period of time are incredibly rare: there is less than a 1 in 1000 chance for this much rainfall over five days in a given year.||The incredible rainfall also led to significant rises and flooding on many rivers in eastern Kentucky including on the main stem of the Kentucky River; North, Middle and South forks of the Kentucky River; Red River and Licking River. At Whitesburg, the North Fork of the Kentucky River swelled well above major flood stage, reaching close to 21' before gauge failure (the previous flood of record was 14.7' in 1957). The North Fork of the Kentucky River at Jackson also reached major flood, setting a new record crest of 43.47' (the previous record was 43.1' set in 1939). The river flooding caused a second round of destruction for communities in the region, and caused flooding in downstream areas that did not receive as much rainfall.||*Note* Given the widespread nature and severity of this event - any dollar amount estimated by storm data will not do the event as a whole justice. Since eastern KY was a national declaration, FEMA will be doing a full cost assessment.

The tree took out the powerlines and part of the power pole as well.","After an intense wind storm in early March, strong to damaging winds once again struck eastern Kentucky on April 1st. Another unseasonably intense low pressure system tracked from the Upper Midwest to across the Great Lakes, pulling a cold front across the area during the wee morning hours of April 1st. Storms along the front put down torrential downpours with pockets of strong gusty winds. This led to a few instances of poor drainage/small stream flooding as well as downed trees before sunrise. However, the more significant weather arrived mid to late morning as skies cleared and southwesterly winds increased sharply ahead of the storm system's secondary cold front. During the midday to mid afternoon hours, southwesterly wind gusts peaked between 30 and 50 mph in many of the valley locations, with gusts of 55 to 60 mph commonly being observed in the more open countryside and atop ridges. The strongest reported gust, 70 mph, was observed at a Kentucky Mesonet station atop Flatwoods (elevation 2,774 feet ASL) in Pike County.||The strong to damaging winds resulted in many trees being blown down onto power lines and snapped power poles. Power outages exceeded more than 50,000 customers across the Commonwealth. A vast majority of those outages were reported in eastern Kentucky and were most concentrated in the eastern Kentucky Coalfield. Kentucky Power, which covers much of southeast Kentucky took 3+ days to restore power in their service area. Repairs included replacing at least 79 power poles, 30 miles of power lines, 70 cross arms, and 44 transformers. The Big Sandy RECC also took at least two days to restore power to 3,171 of its approximately 12,500 customers. Aside from damage to power infrastructure, two individuals reportedly sustained injuries during the high wind event -- a branch struck a hiker near Natural Bridge and another tree fell on a fire truck in Letcher County. There were also numerous reports of downed trees and multiple instances of structural damage. The most notable building damage was reported in Floyd County where the Triple A Market in Martin lost its roof and an apartment building in Prestonsburg partially collapsed.",217

Many locations saw snowfall tallies approaching a half foot or more. The highest snowfall report was 9.3 inches about 4 miles northeast of Booneville.||As the storm moved away on Tuesday, the arctic air remained entrenched over eastern Kentucky as strong high pressure built northeastward from the from the Tennessee Valley.
